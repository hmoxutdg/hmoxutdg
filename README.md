> Blade of the Fallen God: Q3 completed & Q4 is a bitch 
> Q4: I'm still experimenting with this, this one is way too slow, 
> After 9 - 11 hours of loop runs in mushroom forest my current progress is [ 2 8 , 0 0 0 / 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 ]

> Finally Got some Automation Activated. But still a long way ahead.
> Plus Loop for Blade Q4 Continued with 85 Smite Damage & 4 Debuffs.
> **Added code for Blade Q3 & Q4 (Q4: Might add 3rd dose)**

> Still NO to any TWO HANDED WEAPONS >> NO to ANY.
> After BLADE back to Grind for Progress. 
> HEALTH instead of ARMOR for NOW & ALWAYS

> Blade OTF >> Q4 >> 40K of 300K Reached.

> 259K of 300K Reached. Blade OTF [Q4]
> Lost 3-4 hours due to unexpected sleep, forgot to put it on Idle looping
> Put It to idle [Q4] at 03:00 AM - 08:00 AM, Hence the about Progress.

> Hopefully be done by today. Maybe by Afternoon i.e. 12 PM. The Grind is om.

> Still researching on increasing attack speed with the Mind Stone / Stone Script

> Went against my ideals and MAXED OUT a Heavy Crossbow. That thing can do **80 dmg/sec** which is 8 **attacks/sec**. Kinda nice. thinking of giving it a red enchanment when i have any available.
