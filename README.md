> 259K of 300K Reached. Blade OTF [Q4]
> Lost 3-4 hours due to unexpected sleep, forgot to put it on Idle looping
> Put It to idle [Q4] at 03:00 AM - 08:00 AM, Hence the about Progress.

> Hopefully be done by today. Maybe by Afternoon i.e. 12 PM. The Grind is om.

> Still researching on increasing attack speed with the Mind Stone / Stone Script

> Went against my ideals and MAXED OUT a Heavy Crossbow. That thing can do **80 dmg/sec** which is 8 **attacks/sec**. Kinda nice. thinking of giving it a red enchanment when i have any available. 

> Oh just reached 10:46 AM & we are at: **294K** >> Yeah might be done by 12:00 PM.

> Houston We did it. **300 Motha Fucking K** of 300K Blade of the Fallen [Q4] @_11:17 AM

> Yo been a week. Wnent on some unusual hiatus/ Day job got stingy, rarely get time to jot down stuff.
> Took a mini break from the game. BACK NOW.

> **DANGER IN THE WOODS** is active. Gonna grind for it. Only 10 days left in this. Seems a bit tough. Lets see what i can achive here.
> Might buy the premium version if i get far enough.

> 00/35 POINTS. Starting to right
> Will take some time, maybe finish over the weekend

[29-08-24]

> Around 20/35 i think. New quests coming every 6 or 12 hours. So the wait begins.


[04-09-24]

> Truth be told. I came to a point where everthign seemed to shun me to the point of no return.
> I know seems cliche but i survived somehow i think. Rethinking my whole strat with the game. It definitely pushes you hard.

> Now the grind continues. Added a new file for rechargingthe broken Talisman.

> Added a file called **Core Gen 1** it'll help with just a generic grind. Automating a few things such as loadout shifting. picking up items when needed + Healing at a good moments notice/auto.

> Pretty basic stuff i know. I kinda deleted everythign trying to start from scratch with a new perspective but what was needed an expansion in current strats rather than starting anew.

>  Broke all of items except my loadout set items. & removed Enchanments from most. Remade items + re enchanted items. To have some clarity of inventory & my mind to be honest.

> This is fun. **Oh 35/35 Dead Wood Event.**
