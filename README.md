> Blade of the Fallen God: Q3 completed & Q4 is a bitch 
> Q4: I'm still experimenting with this, this one is way too slow, 
> After 9 - 11 hours of loop runs in mushroom forest my current progress is [ 2 8 , 0 0 0 / 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 ]

> Finally Got some Automation Activated. But still a long way ahead.
> Plus Loop for Blade Q4 Continued with 85 Smite Damage & 4 Debuffs.
> **Added code for Blade Q3 & Q4 (Q4: Might add 3rd dose)**

> Still NO to any TWO HANDED WEAPONS >> NO to ANY.
> After BLADE back to Grind for Progress. 
> HEALTH instead of ARMOR for NOW & ALWAYS

> Blade OTF >> Q4 >> 40K of 300K Reached.

> 259K of 300K Reached. Blade OTF [Q4]
> Lost 3-4 hours due to unexpected sleep, forgot to put it on Idle looping
> Put It to idle [Q4] at 03:00 AM - 08:00 AM, Hence the about Progress.

> Hopefully be done by today. Maybe by Afternoon i.e. 12 PM. The Grind is om.

> Still researching on increasing attack speed with the Mind Stone / Stone Script

> Went against my ideals and MAXED OUT a Heavy Crossbow. That thing can do **80 dmg/sec** which is 8 **attacks/sec**. Kinda nice. thinking of giving it a red enchanment when i have any available. 

> Oh just reached 10:46 AM & we are at: **294K** >> Yeah might be done by 12:00 PM.

> Houston We did it. **300 Motha Fucking K** of 300K Blade of the Fallen [Q4] @_11:17 AM

> Yo been a week. Wnent on some unusual hiatus/ Day job got stingy, rarely get time to jot down stuff.
> Took a mini break from the game. BACK NOW.

> **DANGER IN THE WOODS** is active. Gonna grind for it. Only 10 days left in this. Seems a bit tough. Lets see what i can achive here.
> Might buy the premium version if i get far enough.

> 00/35 POINTS. Starting to right
> Will take some time, maybe finish over the weekend


**[29-08-24]**

> Around 20/35 i think. New quests coming every 6 or 12 hours. So the wait begins.


**[04-09-24] P1**

> Truth be told. I came to a point where everthign seemed to shun me to the point of no return.
> I know seems cliche but i survived somehow i think. Rethinking my whole strat with the game. It definitely pushes you hard.

> Now the grind continues. Added a new file for rechargingthe broken Talisman.

> Added a file called **Core Gen 1** it'll help with just a generic grind. Automating a few things such as loadout shifting. picking up items when needed + Healing at a good moments notice/auto.

> Pretty basic stuff i know. I kinda deleted everythign trying to start from scratch with a new perspective but what was needed an expansion in current strats rather than starting anew.

>  Broke all of items except my loadout set items. & removed Enchanments from most. Remade items + re enchanted items. To have some clarity of inventory & my mind to be honest.

> This is fun. **Oh 35/35 Dead Wood Event.**

> Shit needed some experimentation. Kept not summoning buddy at start of each loop.

> Added some minor adjustments + default loadout + item cooldown condition to "aether_talisman"

> Okay so there is something bloody wrong with the Mind Fucking Stone.
> This bloody thing literally has a mind of its own. Sometimes the same code works and sometimes it doesn't. I am no even kidding i have been editing the same snippet of code multiplae fucking time just to do the same thing evertime.

> The code was working fine tomorrow till the night. Stopped working. Some **MINDSTONE . MAIN** issue God knows what that is.
> Edited the code, had no make multiple changes, rewrite most of the code then it started working somehow.

> The fuck was wrong with it.... I have no clue. It stopped working NOW too. and i am trying to fix whatever is wrong with it now.

**> This is me at 11:00 AM.**

> I think it has something to do with **FRAMES**, is that makes any sense.
> Okay so what the code is supposed to do is....

**> summon void & when summon.count = 1, shift to a specefic loadout.**

> The instance hits the ticker to summon the VOID but immediately shifts to the Loadout before completing the summon action. The summon Count increases to 1 but the summon doesn't get completely summoned. 
> So this iswhere i am at. I keep making changes, sometimes they work out, but other or **most** of the time things get pretty much EFFED up.


**[05-09-24] P2 03:00 PM**

> Yup Fuck my Life. Been reading up and down the fucking manual for the past few hours. Checking to see if something could be added.
> But all for naught, Deleted the snippet which was messing things up, jumbled the order, messed around with it. 

> And somehow just somehow, It worked. I dont have the brain cells to think on **HOW**, but its working for now. SO i am happy. Made the change in the file **"The Code That Works"**. Check it out if you need.

> I'm Out. Fuck that Snake too....

> And that EMERALD EGG is way too shiny for me. I might buy the Subscription for the month. I might. 


**[05-09-24] P3 04:19 PM**

> Yeah so the code is currently in effect and working fine.
