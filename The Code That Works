> Okay so this code works well. It's a simple script, But the order matters in code and it has some smooth output results. 

> Currently running a loop based on this script. Good results after a while. It also depends on your loadout. 
> I'll specify what each loadout of mine is. 

// L0: The stash + Not a real loadout + Potion
// L1: PW + FW = AOE + Wands + Magic
// L2: FS + VBS = Swords + Physical + Melee
// L3: Sh + Cr = Nagaraja Tougue Resist
// L4: Railgun: Repeating Crossbow
// L5: Pick Me Up = Star + Eth Talisman
// L6: A bonus
