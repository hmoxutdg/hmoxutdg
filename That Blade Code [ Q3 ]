// Now for the Blade Code
// Foe count can be greater that 4 or 5 
// Both for Quest 3 & Quest 4

// Q3: Defeat 35 unique foes using Blade Activate R
// Q4: Actibvate R >> Get Smite >> Inflict debuffs >> Get 300000 total damage using debuffs >> Counts only damage against bosses.

 Loadout 1

// So what it does is, it equips the blade when there are 4 or more enemies on screen >> activates ability >> and switches back to your main loadout
